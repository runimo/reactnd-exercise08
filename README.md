This was an exercise in the Udacity React Nanodegree. The task was to make a given app interactive and break it down into components. 

The app shows two chat windows for the two users Amy and John. The messages they send to each other appear in both chat windows. In Amy's chat window, her own messages are displayed in green and John's messages are displayed in blue. In John's chat window, his own messages are displayed in green and Amy's messages are displayed in blue.
